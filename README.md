# Algorithm Design Manual Questions

Welcome to my repository where I solve problems from **The Algorithm Design Manual** by Steven S. Skiena (2020). This repository is structured to provide solutions to the various algorithmic problems presented in the book.

## Repository Structure

All solutions are organized into chapters, specifically in the `chapter-3` directory where each directory corresponds to a question from Chapter 3. The structure is as follows:

```
algorithm-design-manual-questions/
├── chapter-3/
│   ├── 3-1/
│   ├── 3-2/
│   ├── 3-3/
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

## Running the Code

To run the code for a specific question, navigate to the directory of the respective question and use the Go command:

```sh
cd chapter-3/3-x
go run .
```

Replace `3-x` with the specific question directory you wish to run.

## Example

To run the code for `3-1`, you would use the following commands:

```sh
cd chapter-3/3-1
go run .
```
